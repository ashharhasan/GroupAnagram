This is part of my interview preparation to solve the most common problems in my own way.
So, following is the problem:

Group Anagram
Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists. You may return the output in any order.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example:

Input: strs = ["act","pots","tops","cat","stop","hat"]

Output: [["hat"],["act", "cat"],["stop", "pots", "tops"]]
